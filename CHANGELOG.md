  `config.requirejs.loader = :almond` in application.rb.

- Fix regression in production env when `paths` specified in requirejs.yml.

# v0.6.0

**NOTE:** Upgrade to 0.6.1! This was yanked due to a regression.

- We now generate a paths config to hit digested assets when needed (in
  `production` or when `config.assets.digest` is true). Fixes #20.
- Support for generating additional data attributes on the require.js script
  tag via `requirejs_include_tag`. See [README](README.md) for details. Closes 
  pull request #32; thanks to @hollow for the submission!

- Pull request #31, closes #30.  Thanks @karelim!

# v0.5.3

- Upgrade to RequireJS and r.js 1.0.4
- Pulled #22, fix for asset compliation failure with no config/requirejs.yml.
  Thanks @arehberg!

# v0.5.2

- Upgrade to RequireJS and r.js 1.0.3

# v0.5.1

- This is a quick turn to fix an issue that could trigger an Anonymous mismatched define() error from require.js and/or r.js.

    The preferred way to use the helper tag is now with an argument, like
    so:

    ```erb
    <%= requirejs_include_tag "application" %>
    ```

    This usage ensures that the above helper will correctly generate a
    data-main attribute for the script tag.  The requirejs_include_tag
    helper still works without an argument, and won't generate data-main
    in that case.

    Thanks to Andrew de Andrade for the catch.

- Precompilation via `rake assets:precompile` is now implemented.
