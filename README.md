# RequireJS for Rails

Integrates [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) into the Rails 3 Asset Pipeline.

**UPGRADE NOTES:** Users upgrading within the 0.x series should read the Changes section for relevant usage changes.  We're pushing hard to 1.0, when the configuration and setup details will be declared stable.  Until that time expect some bumps as things bake out.

## Usage

1. Add this to your Rails app's `Gemfile`:

    ```
    gem 'requirejs-rails'
    ```

2. Remove all Sprockets directives such as `//= require jquery` from `application.js` and elsewhere.  Instead establish JavaScript dependencies using AMD-style `define()` and `require()` calls.

3. Use `requirejs_include_tag` at the top-level of your app's layout(s).  Other modules will be pulled in dynamically by `require.js` in development and for production builds optimized by `r.js`.  Here's a basic `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` modified for `requirejs-rails`:

    ```erb
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>Frobnitz Online</title>
      <%= stylesheet_link_tag    "application" %>
      <%= requirejs_include_tag "application" %>
      <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
    </head>
    <body>

    <%= yield %>

    </body>
    </html>
    ```

4. Organize your JavaScript or CoffeeScript code into modules using `define()`:

      ```coffeescript
      # app/assets/javascripts/views/tweet_view.js.coffee

      define ['backbone'], (Backbone) ->
        class TweetView extends Backbone.View
          # ...
      ```

5. Instantiate your app using `require()` from a top-level module such as `application.js`:

      ```coffeescript
      # app/assets/javascripts/application.js.coffee

      require ['jquery', 'backbone', 'TheApp'], ($, Backbone, TheApp) ->

        # Start up the app once the DOM is ready
        $ ->
          window.App = new TheApp()
          Backbone.history.start
            pushState: true
          window.App.start()
      ```

6. When ready, build your assets for production deployment as usual.  `requirejs-rails` defaults to a single-file build of `application.js`.  Additional modules and r.js layered builds may be specified via `config\requirejs.yml`; see the Configuration section below.

    ```rake assets:precompile```

## Configuration

Configuration lives in `config/requirejs.yml`.  These values are inspected and used by `requirejs-rails` and passed along as configuration for require.js and `r.js`.  This replaces the use of `require.config()` in v0.0.2.  The default configuration declares `application.js` as the sole top-level module.  This can be overridden by creating a `config/requirejs.yml`, such as:

```yaml
modules:
  - name: 'mytoplevel'
```

You may pass in [require.js config options](http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#config) as needed.  For example, to add path parameters:

```yaml
paths:
  d3: "d3/d3"
  "d3.time": "d3/d3.time"
```

Only modules specified in the configuration will be created as build artifacts by `r.js`.  [Layered r.js builds](http://requirejs.org/docs/faq-optimization.html#priority) be configured like so:

```yaml
modules:
  - name: 'appcommon'
  - name: 'page1'
    exclude: ['appcommon']
  - name: 'page2'
    exclude: ['appcommon']
```

As a guideline, each module in the configuration should either be referenced by a `requirejs_include_tag` in a template or pulled in via a dynamic `require()` call.  Modules which are solely referenced by a dynamic `require()` call (i.e. a call not optimized by r.js) **must** be specified in the modules section in order to produce a correct build.

## Using AMD libraries

I currently recommend placing your AMD libraries into `vendor/assets/javascripts`.  The needs of a few specific libraries are discussed below.

### jQuery

jQuery users must use jQuery 1.7 or later (`jquery-rails >= 1.0.17`) to use it as an [AMD module](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/AsynchronousDefinition) with RequireJS.  To use jQuery in a module:

```coffeescript
# app/assets/javascripts/hello.js

define ['jquery'], ($) ->
  (id) ->
    $(id).append('<div>hello!</div>')
```

### Backbone.js

Backbone AMD support is underway.  See pull request documentcloud/backbone#710 for details.  In the meantime, you can download [Backbone 0.5.3 with AMD support](https://github.com/jrburke/backbone/raw/optamd3/backbone.js) from [jrburke's optamd3 branch](https://github.com/jrburke/backbone/tree/optamd3).  Backbone's module name is `backbone`.

### Underscore.js

Underscore version 1.2.2 or later has integrated AMD support.  Get it from [Underscore.js' homepage](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/). Underscore's module name is `underscore`.

## Changes

Usage changes that impact folks upgrading along the 0.x series are documented here.

### v0.5.1

- `requirejs_include_tag` now generates a data-main attribute if given an argument, ala:

    ```erb
	<%= requirejs_include_tag "application" %>
	```

    This usage is preferred to using a separate `javascript_include_tag`, which will produce errors from require.js or r.js if the included script uses define anonymously, or not at all.

### v0.5.0

- `application.js` is configured as the default top-level module for r.js builds.
- It is no longer necessary or desirable to specify `baseUrl` explicitly in the configuration.
- Users should migrate application configuration previously in `application.js` (ala `require.config(...)`) to `config/requirejs.yml`

See [the Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for other details

## TODOs

- Sample app, including jQuery usage
- Generator and/or template support.. ?
